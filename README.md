# English for Humans

A movement advocating for sensible spelling reform across English-speaking communities worldwide.

## The Problem

Why do we spell the same word two different ways? **Neighbor** (American) vs **Neighbour** (English) creates real-world complications—from emergency response systems like Neighbor SOS that need dual implementation, to L1 and L2 learners struggling with arbitrary spelling rules.

**The solution?** Simplify to **Naybor**—phonetic, intuitive, and universal.

## The Movement

English for Humans champions spelling reform across three dialect branches:

### 1. **English For Humans** 
- The reformed UK King's English variant

- **Not Orwellian**: Language by the people, for the people—liberating, not controlling

## Featured Resources

- **Research**: Educational studies on spelling complexity and literacy development
- **Community**: Open discussions on valuable proposals supporting fundamental human needs

## Why Reform Matters

- **Emergency Response**: Simplifies critical systems (Neighbor SOS and similar platforms)
- **Education**: Accelerates learning for children and adults
- **Global Communication**: Bridges the Atlantic divide in spelling
- **Logical Consistency**: Phonetic spelling that makes sense

This is a global movement. Whether you're a linguist, educator, developer, or simply care about making language more accessible—your voice matters. We especially welcome proposals for Blessed Dialect, which as the youngest variant offers the most flexibility for valuable, consensus-driven changes.
